# HTML Guessing Game

This is a simple and fun guessing game in HTML where you have to match the computer's choice of a number between 1 and 10.

## How to play

- Open the `index.html` file in your browser.
- Enter your guess in the input box and click the `Check` button.
- You will see a message telling you if you got it right or wrong, and giving you a hint if you need one.
- You can keep guessing until you find the correct answer.

## How it works

- The game uses JavaScript to generate a random number between 1 and 10 and store it in a variable called `answer`.
- The game also uses JavaScript to get the user's input from the input element and compare it with the answer.
- The game uses HTML to display the instructions, the input box, the button and the result message.
- The game uses CSS to style the elements and make them look nice.
